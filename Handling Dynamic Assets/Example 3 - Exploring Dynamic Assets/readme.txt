Introduction
Welcome etc. etc...

TODO : change this readme to an introductory document once the following have been put in place.


(remove this remaining section once completed)
In this folder we should include base references needed to get example 1orking
This could include 

- staring state models
- jpg/png for scannable barcodes
- usable bat/powershell scripts for the product  API
- in other examples, we've also included a pdf version of the doc so that users can print it out if they need it
