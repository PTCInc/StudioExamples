Introduction

Welcome to Handling Dynamic Assets - example 2

In this folder you will find a zip of the Experience - you can import this into Vuforia Studio
The experience reuses the same product IDs = the same barcodes - as the previous example.

Creo Illustrate projects - one for each quadcopter - are included. You can follow along with the instructions, and compare your progress against these
completed examples.  You can also publish the required quadcopter models directly from these completed examples.
